Arcivr Coding Exercise:

Create a simple web application for performing currency conversions.  Your app should allow the user to select two 
currencies, enter an amount in one of the currencies, and see what the value would be in the other currency.  
For example, I should be able to choose USD and GBP, enter 100 for USD, and see a conversion value like 114.21 GBP
As a bonus, it would be nice if the user could see a historical view of the chosen exchange rate.  That could be in 
the form of a chart, or a table, or whatever you prefer.
You can use one of the many publicly available APIs to look up the exchange rates.  (https://exchangeratesapi.io 
and https://fixer.io are both good options.)
Please use React to build the UI.  Other than that, feel free to use any libraries & tools that you like.

app and api in docker container: 
reference: https://github.com/mrcoles/node-react-docker-compose


// 
To calculate how much of a foreign currency you’ll get with a particular exchange rate, 
divide the amount of money you’re starting with by the exchange rate. 


// 
Rates are quoted against the Euro by default. 
Quote against a different currency by setting the base parameter in your request.

// UPDATE NPM PACKAGES: 
docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash  THEN run npm update from inside the container.

    <input type="text" placeholder="Email" name="Email" ref={register({required: true, pattern: /^\S+@\S+$/i})} />
    // validation attribute:   ref={register({required: true, pattern: /^\S+@\S+$/i})}

        // ALPHA only:  /^[a-z0-9]+$/i 
        ref={register({required: true, pattern: /^[a-z0-9]+$/ )}
        // NUMERIC only:     /^[0-9]+$/
